      As a general rule, the data We process about You (collected via the Site, any of our Apps or
      otherwise) will be stored and processed within the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area
      (EEA) or any other non-EEA country deemed by the European Commission to offer an adequate

      In some cases, it may be necessary for Us to transfer Your Personal Data to a non-EEA country
      not considered by the European Commission to offer an adequate level of protection (for
      example to one or more of Our data processors located there). For example, for the
      implementation of Your desired transaction it can be necessary that We disclose Your Personal

      In such cases, apart from all appropriate safeguards that We implement, in any case, to
      protect Your Personal Data, We have put in place additional adequate measures. For example, We
      have ensured that the recipient is bound by the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (the EU Model
      Clauses) designed to protect Your Personal Data as though it were an intra-EEA transfer. You
