        We will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary
      </strong>
      (taking into consideration the purpose for which it was originally
      obtained). The criteria We use to determine what is ‘necessary’ depends on
      the particular Personal Data in question and the specific relationship We
      have with You (including its duration).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Our normal practice is to determine whether there is/are any specific EU
      and/or Maltese law(s) (for example tax or corporate laws) <strong>permitting</strong> or even
      <em><strong>obliging</strong></em> Us
      to keep certain Personal Data for a certain period of time (in which case
      We will keep the Personal Data for the maximum period indicated by any such
      law). For example, any data that can be deemed to be ‘accounting records’
      must be kept for ten (10 years).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      We would also have to determine whether there are any laws and/or
      contractual provisions that may be invoked against Us by You and/or third
      parties and if so, what the prescriptive periods for such actions are (this
      is usually five (5) years in those cases where Our contractual relationship
      with You terminates or two (2) years in those cases where no such
      contractual relationship exists). In this case, We will keep any relevant
      Personal Data that We may need to defend Ourselves against any claim(s),
      challenge(s) or other such action(s) by You and/or third parties for such
      time as is necessary.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      <strong>
        Where Your Personal Data are no longer required by Us, We will either
        securely delete or anonymise the Personal Data in question.
