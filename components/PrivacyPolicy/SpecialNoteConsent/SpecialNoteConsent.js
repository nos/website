    <p align="justify">
      For the avoidance of all doubt, We would like to point out that in those limited cases where
      We cannot or choose not to rely on another legal ground (for example, Our legitimate
      interests), We will process Your Personal Data on the basis of Your consent. In some cases, We
      will require Your explicit consent, for example, when, on the basis of Your explicit consent
      We will process special categories of data concerning You such as Your health data (for
      example when informing Us about a disability such as colour blindness).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      In those cases where We process on the basis of Your consent (<strong>which We will never
      presume</strong> but which We shall have obtained in a clear and manifest manner from You),
      <strong>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME</strong> and this, in the same
      manner as You shall have provided it to Us.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Should You exercise Your right to withdraw Your consent at any time (by writing to Us at the
      physical or email address below), We will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal
      basis exists for processing Your Personal Data (for example, on the basis of a legal
      obligation to which We are subject) where We would be legally authorised (or even obliged) to
      process Your Personal Data without needing Your consent and if so, notify You accordingly.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      When We ask for such Personal Data, You may always decline, however should You decline to
      provide Us with necessary data that We require to provide requested services, We may not
      necessarily be able to provide You with such services (especially if consent is the only legal
      ground that is available to Us).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Just to clarify, <strong>consent is not the only ground that permits Us to process Your
      Personal Data</strong>. In the last preceding section above We pointed out the various grounds
      that We rely on when processing Your Personal Data for specific purposes.

      All reasonable efforts are made to keep any Personal Data We may hold about You up-to-date and
      as accurate as possible. You can check the information that We hold about You at any time by
      contacting Us in the manner explained <a href="#company">below</a>. If You find any
      inaccuracies, We will correct them and where required, delete them as necessary.{' '}
