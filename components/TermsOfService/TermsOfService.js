              The Company’s software and platform and all of the matters set

              might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption.
              It is possible that no blockchain utilising the software will
              be ever launched and there may never be an operational
              platform. You should not rely on the software or the ability to
              receive tokens associated with the nOS Platform in the future.
              Even if the software is completed, implemented and adopted, it
              might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with
              a blockchain adopting the software may not have the
              functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology
              is changing rapidly, so the nOS Tokens and any tokens
              transferable on the nOS Platform may become outdated.

              negatively impact tokens in various ways, including, for
              example, through a determination that tokens are regulated
              financial instruments that require registration. The Company
